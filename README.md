# Forgotten Realm: The Mushroom Man's Tale
## About
The intended player experience is an immersive survival adventure where players spawn at a portal and must explore three villages, collecting food, fighting enemies, and upgrading their gear. In the second village, they meet a Mushroom Man who guides them to find the final gem, allowing them to open the portal and complete their quest.
